# WebView 

## Hello!

WebView is android web browser created from The Open Source Project of WebViewClient and WebChromeClient. 

WebView is designed to work for both newer and older android versions, also it can run in mobile phones with less than 1GB RAM and it support android TV. 

Fun fact it is lightweight less than 3MB and ads free. 

We're working 24/7 to maintain the app and provide much better browsing experience. 

WebView is program to avoid battery drain and memory issues cause by the app services.
